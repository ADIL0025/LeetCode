# 100 Days Of Code

This repository contains the code and logs for my 100 days of code challenge. I am committed to coding for at least one hour every day for the next 100 days, regardless of my experience level. I will be learning new programming concepts and skills along the way, and I will be sharing my progress in this repository.

## Goals

The goals of this challenge are to:

• Learn to code consistently for a long period of time   
• Build my coding skills and knowledge                 
• Stay motivated and accountable           
• Connect with other people who are also coding

## Progress 

I will be updating this repository with my progress every day. This includes the code that I write, the resources that I use, and any challenges that I face. I will also be sharing my thoughts and reflections on the challenge.
